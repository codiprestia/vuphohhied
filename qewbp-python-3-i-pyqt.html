When using Plasma if I set a Qt style and run a python application that uses pyqt or pyside (such as "python3 random\_app.py") then it'll use the system style. However, in other desktops/WMs such as Gnome and i3 while I can use kvantum and qt5cr to set a Qt theme that regular Qt desktop applications will respect - any python scripts using pyqt or pyside don't. Instead they default to the Qt style pre-packaged with the pyqt / pyside wheel.

Guys I have been trying my best to come up with this by searching online but there's so much information that I don't know where to begin with. So here's the deal, for my final project in energy engineering I'm required to develop a software that : \- Receives input data from a user regarding power consumption and steam quality requirements \- Use technical specs of heat recovery steam generators and gas engines to size CHP units \- Present a comparison between different viable solutions. √ê¬ü√ë¬Ä√ê¬æ√ë √ê¬æ√ë¬Ä√ê¬µ√ê¬Ω√ê¬æ√ê¬∫ √ê¬ù.√ê¬ê. –ü—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ —á–µ–º –º—ã –Ω–∞—á–Ω–µ–º —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—Å —è–∑—ã–∫–∞, –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –¥–≤–∞ –∑–∞–º–µ—á–∞–Ω–∏—è. I know C is obvious one. But if one would use emac/vim what are other good languages to develop on and for openBSD ? What are the typical problems ? For example i would imagine C# to not really work well. Tho maybe with new .Net Core ? Haskell is listed as tier 2 support and maintained by community. Heard some versions of GHC weren't stable. What about Python ecosystem ? pyqt ? pandas, numpy ? R, rstudio ?

Hello people, I have been looking online to create a GUI. The option that grabbed my attention was using PyQT with the QTdesigner and then coding the underlying code to the gui itself. While that aprt goes very well. (The app works and all is good) I can't seem to find any solution to compress or use it in an easier way than running it with a Python enabled computer. I have tried py2exe, but it only gave me error codes. Then I tried using cx_Freeze next, but while it does create the build folder. –î—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á Python 3 –∏ PyQt 5: –†–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π IMG –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ: –ë–•–í-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥ –ñ–∞–Ω—Ä: Python –ö–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ: –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–µ –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü:. 
I have a python application using pyqt that I am currently operating in Windows 7 (because I need to be able to send TCP commands to a 3rd party Windows application which is running on the same machine).

Nowadays Python is one of the most popular programming languages. Specialists value its universality for all types of the tasks. Today, one of the most important qualities is convenience of command execution, but often developers have to write a relatively simple program, the quality criterion of which is an intuitive graphical interface. You have several ways to do this by means of Python. The following development tools are among the most popular: PyQt (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).

Hi A few months back, I read about a malicious clipboard hijacker discovered in PyPi (https://medium.com/@bertusk/cryptocurrency-clipboard-hijacker-discovered-in-pypi-repository-b66b8a534a8), and decided to write a tool that demonstrates how easy it is for a rogue program to mess with your system clipboard without you knowing. To make things interesting, I built this tool around the classic idea (https://twitter.com/peterritchie/status/534011965132120064) of replacing semicolon with a simila. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω –±–∞–∑–æ–≤—ã–π —Å–∏–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Å–∏—Å —è–∑—ã–∫–∞ Python: —Ç–∏–ø—ã –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö, –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—ã, —É—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è, —Ü–∏–∫–ª—ã, —Ä–µ–≥—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –≤—ã—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏, –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–Ω–æ-–æ—Ä–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ.

So, I've been stuck with this problem for days. I'm a beginner in Python Desktop application development. And I just can't, for the life of me, figure out how to use QThreads properly. I have a worker object, and a gui here that has two combo boxes: when a user chooses an item on the comboWorkspace, the items on the comboModel will load. What's happening is that whenever I choose from comboWorkspace, it will run the get\_workspaces function from the worker again. This is probably because –ö–∞–∫ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—É –Ω–∞ PyQT. –°–æ–∑–¥–∞—ë–º –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ–µ –æ–∫–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ PyQT5 –∏ Python 3.6. http://solkogan.ru/python.php?mode=view2mid=25. Hey everyone, For my university i‚Äôm working on a project where in we need to develop an interactive learning environment (where people can use python to code things themselves). In this environment student should he able to learn thing about systems and control, using basic controllers and devellop their own controllers. Think of it as basic examples like a cruise control. To do this we decided that we want to built a GUI using PyQt5. For the cruise control a student should be able to write. 
Hey. I've been trying for quite some time now to get my python program to run with a pyqt GUI. However my program was made to work in the cmd terminal from start and runs two infinite "while true" loops in two different threads. The plan was to make the GUI and program run simultaneously by using pyqt threading. So far I'm not successful, and each time I start up my program the GUI hangs and crashes. Is this the right approach to doing things? Does my program have to be a QTObject Python 3 –∏ PyQt 5. –†–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π (2016) –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—ã: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –î—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–≤, –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ–∫. –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ–∫.
