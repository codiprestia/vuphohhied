Our team decided on the steakhouse in town because we had a great time there last year and it was one of my favorite places in town for brunch and late-night drinks. I called the week before and made reservations for our party of 11, and when they asked if this was for a special occasion I told them who we were and what we were celebrating. I show up first and it is clear that the staff was not prepared. Going through old issues of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and posting highlights in my own words. For anyone interested, I highly recommend signing up for the actual site at f4wonline ( and checking out the full archives. --- PREVIOUS YEARS ARCHIVE: 1991 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/4so8a9/wrestling_observer_rewind_12231991_final_post_for/) • 1992 (https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/51m67r/wrestling_observer_rewind_dec_28_1. Sorry for formatting—I’m on mobile. It’s pretty long, so there’s a TL;DR at the end. Almost a full year ago, fall semester, I met this guy named Jack Johnson (not a real name, of course) at a party. I came with a friend who lived in the apartment—apparently they had a class together—and met this son of a bitch. Immediately, I could tell that something was off. He had an aggressive vibe, and occasionally, he would stroke girls’ thighs, mine included. I was put off, but I didn’t really think. 
I think most of you understand what I am referring to - specifically the AMA last night from u/ECBallboy, a verified ball-boy. Now, OP gave a LOT of interesting accounts of his experiences, and this is not to say he does not have credibility or is lying but some of the things in that AMA seem quite embellished or exaggerated that just don't check out. This post is to just point out some of the things that seem odd, and to remind r/NBA of what this sub has come to - we have, as a subreddit Hey guys - After a few hours off doing work and kid stuff, not gonna lie, when I came back here I hoped someone had already done this! Instead of whining I've decided to do it myself. This is an "analysis" of the longer trailer here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcTvQx1Wot0ampt=28s). It does not include the stuff from S2 from the beginning of the trailer. None of that seemed particularly important beyond reminding us of S2. Please lmk your thoughts. Ask anything. Challenge anything. Instead of ending the series with a bang in true GOT-style we're now stuck with a generic ending where the "good guys" supposedly eliminate a perceived threat and live happily ever after. This show was interesting because of the lack of a clear distinction between "good" and "bad". Actions have consequences, power is power; fuck ups get you killed. Just like in real life. The moral grayness of ASOIAF and its characters is what made the series so infamous and popular to begin Go back in time and remember when Ned Stark got beheaded. Remember the grief and shock you felt because GRRM had killed off the one character who was front runner for main character in the show. This was a quick lesson for everyone who had been watching season 1 that ANY character CAN die. These two words; " any ", and " can ", are key here. GRRM didn't kill Ned Stark for no purpose whatsoever, it wasn't just a random death in order to shock the audience and make everyone. 
I’m a bridesmaid for one of my best childhood friends. She was engaged in February; wedding is in August, and she asked me in early March. Shortly after, the bride texted the bridal party with instructions for buying our gowns: she’d placed the order at David's Bridal for one of three dresses, all the same color and length, but different necklines. All we had to do was go in, give her name to the employee, and they’d bring out the selected gowns to try on. We’d then choose our neckline For me personally and I know some people might disagree but I think why I am so irritated with the Mad Queen spin is the poor foreshadowing. Dany's arc has been a journey of rising from nothing and keeping her inner demons in check. That's known but the examples people are using to justify this heel turn are too understandable. Its been a while since I watched earlier seasons so I may be missing some events but here are a few I came up with. 1) She let her husband kill her abusive brother. Every time I watch Season 4 (my favorite season), it strikes me that Rory is probably dealing with (or rather not dealing with) depression that never really gets addressed. Let's take stock here. At the beginning of Season 4, Rory has just broken up with Jess, which wasn't really a breakup, but a glorified ghosting. She went from being in a relationship with someone she loved / was considering having sex with only for him to skip town suddenly with barely any explanation. Some years ago I decided to go alone on a beautiful two day hike a few hours away from where I lived. I decided to do it because I wanted to challenge myself as I hadn't really done much on my own at that age and highly dependent on other people. If you're familiar with the route and in good shape you can complete it in one day, but due to me getting lost and stopping to enjoy the scenery I had to set up camp twice. A couple of years later I met a girl that I fell in love with instantly. RS starts talking about spoilers (Deleted spoilers, sorry!) Starts podcast with Jen: - She says her kids have started asking about the show, think it is kind of cool, but aren’t old enough to truly understand it. She loves that there’s like no footage from her seasons available. She did say that she has the DVD’s though - She watched the first season of the Bachelor and then got really into it during Aaron’s season. Her girlfriend nominated her and convinced TL;DR: This is long. But I basically go through certain characters's whose arc in the last episode gave me the message that no matter what you do, you'll never be anything more than the worst of yourself. It's a bleak-ass message for a supposedly bittersweet ending. amp#x200B; I'm still barely keeping it together after the explosion of disappointment that was "The Bells," but I had made an allusion to this point the last thing I posted. I watched the episode twice, then the "Inside. My theory is that Sansa will sit on the iron throne, as supported by the theory I call the lion, the witch and the water basin theory. But before this, Arya (Azor Ahai) will kill the following in this order: • the Nights King / the long night through his heart with a ‘water tempered sword’; tick!!! • ‘the lion’ (Jaime Lannister); and, • uses Jaime’s face to kill ‘Nissa Nissa - Jamie’s wife/lover’ (Cersei). amp#x200B; What is the water basin? gtLightbringer prophecy - ‘Darknes. (cross posted from /Startrek, but cleaned up for here) I’ve been watching TNG nightly with my son, and like so many, this is my 50th rewatch, but Discovery seems to have been the feather that broke the camel’s back, so to speak, in how I’m seeing TNG. To reiterate: I think the problems I’ve been a first hand witness to on mid 90s message boards thru the present with DS9/Enterprise/Discovery aren’t due to those shows not fitting in, but because TNG doesn’t fit, yet has become to many the defin. 
This is a continuation thread in an effort to summarize all the Foreshadowing and Callbacks from each episode, feel free to point out anything that might be missing it will be added into the post! amp#x200B; There will be a minor difference in this post which i will instead delve a little into each character in this episode as well. Also as always at the end of the post i share some final thoughts on the entire episode. (Special shout out to Starbucks for sponsoring this episode) amp#x200. \ \ This will be updated until the official episode-by-episode spoilers come out. amp#x200B; Link to live bracketed spoilers spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipmyrbQ64TisQvrs016m7ntcoHQ_f2O_plJmkVZK16k/edit?usp=sharing) (screenshot below) Spreadsheet and screenshot below will be updated as more information comes out. https://i.redd.it/fqcwao2ch9w21.png With the season starting, I figured I'd recap everything that's been spoiled (within reason) since we normally. I’m so exhausted. Not physically, but mentally. My mind is slowly turning into porridge and my heart has been broken enough times to turn it into a mosaic. Before you think I’m just another whiny victim, please hear me out. Although, I think part of me doesn’t even care if you hear me out, because it’s probably going to end up being in vain anyway. I have learned death happens much more than people realize. amp#x200B; I remember my first death. Well, I remember all of my deaths 
I'm wiped. It's been another long day, but here comes part Three. For those who missed part Two (https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/axmflo/my_two_years_with_ek_and_em_part_2/?st=jsx5oaigampsh=268240a3) Post completion note: I just finished writing this. It's past midnight. I am now TRULY wiped. Please forgive me if there are any mistakes, I don't have the energy to read through it all to make corrections. Brief intro: I'm going to start this part of this compilation So let me start off by saying I'm Team Michael, but I've never despised Rafael or had anything really bad to say about him. I think both men have made mistakes and I think they've both grown from it. I just prefer Michael. This post isn't about Michael vs Rafael, but about some interesting takes on Michael's character. I've seen a lot of posts and comments about how people dislike Michael because he makes them uneasy. He's manipulative. He's a stalker. He's just creepy. I've personally never.

Kimiko Yukimura, PhD in being a total loser WARNING: This article covers serious issues including domestic abuse, read at your own risk. For those of you who have read my past content regarding Total Drama, you'd know that I have a negative opinion towards Courtney and an (almost unhealthy) infatuation with Duncan as he is my favourite character. For this I'm going to push my own feelings aside and looking at this in an unbiased manner. That being said, this article focuses a lot on Courtn. </p>
