Just as the title suggests. In parallel to my idea of obtaining a newly "minted" C64C case and sticking a C64R inside, I've got a C64 and a C64-C I want to revive (at least one, so I can harvest the other for parts). The C64 breadbox almost definitely has a dead PLA chip. I've seen various solutions and I think the cheapest one will be to stick an EEPROM daughterboard on it with an AT27C512R. I've been googling about for a few days, but with no luck - does anybody have a schematic for the daugh. What makes iComps so great?

Hi ! Let me first say that this is my first post here, and I'm not sure this is the right place to ask questions. If I should rather post somewhere else, or maybe on another website, just tell me. I've got this problem going on for some time now. I cannot seem to be able to compile a document in TeXmaker when it contains a bibliography, or at least when using biber to compile it.

Been using the Gentium Plus font to write documents for a while, all is great; however, I tried printing some polytonic Greek today, and they displayed as boxes.

I‚Äôm currently doing virtual wholesaling. I have a virtual assistant sending about 40 ‚Äúsoft offers‚Äù per day to realtors on websites like Redfin for properties that meet my criteria. I‚Äôm basically seeking out run down properties that need some work. Once the assistant identifies a target property, they try to use icomps.com to find the value of 3 similar properties. They then get the average of those 3 and send a simple email to the realtor giving a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù offer of 60% - 70% of the average.
