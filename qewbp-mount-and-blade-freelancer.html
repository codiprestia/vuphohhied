                            <p>Mount & Blade:Freelancer gives the player the option to immerse themselves in combat between the Lords of Calradia serving on the front line, you are no longer the commander YOU serve your Lord as a soldier. You will gain experience in your commanders. In short, the idea is the same as the idea of a 'nuzlocke' in Pokemon. A set of self-imposed rules to create a challenge or just a different experience.

It works in every mod that incorporates Freelancer (works better with mods that incorporate formations too however), and you can enable Brainy Bots on every mod too. Or you should be able to. Anyhow In the words of the creator of the Freelancer mod: "Freelancer adds the option to a mod to serve a Lord as a soldier, as you gain experience in your commanders army you will gain rank better gear, if you're hungry the quartermaster will feed you. You will gain followers and have the option. Considering I haven't bought a spacesim in some time, so far I've seen some games on sale: House of the Dying Sun (combat) Everspace (combat) No Man's Sky (exploration/survival) Elite Dangerous (exploration/combat/trade?) is on 60% off right now Rebel Galaxy (Black Flag/Freelancer mix) is 80% off Void Destroyer 2 (MountampBlade in Space apparently?!) amp#x200B; My biggest problem these days is that so many space sims lack a real storyline.

In the spirit of the holidays, of course :) Apart from the popular ones (space legs, atmospheric landings, SRV variety etc) I think a military career ala Mount amp Blade could make the factions feel a lot more "alive." For those who have not played MampB, as part of your journey to the top, you had the option of pledging yourself. So I'm playing Floris Expanded and I think it's awesome that I can enlist in a lord's army and get promoted and stuff like that, but every. 
I've always loved games where your decisions and actions would align you with various factions. One example was the old space sim Freelancer (and the newer Discovery mod) , where you could decide to join various factions by running missions for them. After a certain amount of reputation, you'd be allowed to buy their faction-specific gear. However, other factions would become hostile to you, so you'd have to balance your reputation if you wanted to be able to move freely. Gaining.
