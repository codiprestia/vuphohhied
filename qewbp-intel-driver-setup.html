                            <p> I’m hoping as some time has passed that someone knows how to get the video working correctly on windows 10. I can’t find a driver that will work anywhere, and I bought this thing on the whole premise that Windows 10 was supported. It works, but is slow as molasses due to non hardware accelerated video. 
I’m trying to build a hackintosh with mojave that also dual boots with windows, but I have a NVIDA GTX 1080. My idea was to boot the hackintosh using the on board graphics and boot windows with the 1080. Is this possible. I know you will think that this is another post about help for shitty nvidia optimus laptops but what i'd really prefer is a more radical solution. I currently have it working with nvidia-xrun that opens an openbox instance on another xserver that runs with the dGPU and the performance are ok but the use experience is not so great i must say. From my experience with it I know that the laptop can use only the iGPU leaving the dGPU powered off and this is the default setup that requires no addit. I have been using these packages since Fedora 24 and they work, but are they the best combination for watching in MPV and Firefox in Fedora 29 with hardware acceleration? I am on Xorg, but might use Wayland if it works with a tablet this time. libva-intel-driver gstreamer1-vaapi gstreamer1-libav ffmpeg mpv If you are in the mood to critique packages, any of these choices seem bad for Fedora 29? They all seem to exist in the repo. but maybe there are updated names. Hello OpenSUSE community, I want to try something new and different to Windows like Linux. Since at college we used OpenSUSE I decided to use the same distro for my laptop. I have 100GB of free unpartitioned space on my SSD (I have left around 65GB for over provisioning) ready to dualboot. Now for some questions before I go and install OpenSUSE. My laptop has two GPUs, Intel and nVidia, will this cause any issues for Linux/OpenSUSE? Do I need to setup anything after installation Hey everyone! Had an issue with setting up suse-prime with the proprietary nVidia driver on Leap 15, but figured out how to get it all up-and-running last night after a little bit of digging through OBS. Making a post here to let others know the solution. Add the nVidia repository via YaST: -> Software Repositories -> Add -> Community Repositories -> nVidia graphics drivers Install the nVidia G05 (410.93) driver via YaST:. Hi! I want a tablet PC with eGPU capability on a budget, so I found that Dell Venue 11 Pro can be had for little money and I can confirm, that GDC Beast generally works with this tablet PC: https://youtu.be/j_Go1OpSers Only thing that stops me from pulling a trigger is if this setup will work with tablet's internal display. So I did a bit of research on my own, I know that the performance will be bad (https://egpu.io/forums/pc-setup/how-much-bandwidth-ovehead-does-optimusx-connect-accelerated-. 
Hello, I have a laptop with intel i7-3632QM and a AMD ATI HD 7730M I was able to get a windows vm running on fedora 29 to scale to 2k. However, i cannot for the life of me get fedora to go above 1080p. I have tried mucking about xrandr, where the system thought it was in 2k, but was certainly not. I have mostly tried on Gnome 3.30, and tried for a few minutes on KDE as well. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thank. https://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/building-a-customac-hackintosh-the-ultimate-buyers-guide/ (https://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/building-a-customac-hackintosh-the-ultimate-buyers-guide/) Do you have to look for new drivers for every hardware piece or can you do small updates seamlessly? Did you guys ever benefit from a small update? If yes, can you tell me a bit more about it? Also, if you didn't have parts from the recommended list would the process of updating Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm having trouble finding the right drivers to use for my Intel Nucs when I deploy with MDT. Can someone please point me in the right direction to find them? On Intel's website I can't seem to find anything older than the nuc5s for inf drivers. hey guys, So I currently have a Kimsufi KS3 dedicated server. It took me like two weeks of tinkering and pestering their useless support until I finally got it working - and ironically only by somebody running the Intel network driver setup at the data center. They don't officially support Windows Server due to licensing (I have my own license from Imagine, what used to be DreamSpark) - years ago they used to offer an IP-based KVM option for something like 20 euros I have a Asus VG248 144hz monitor which can obviously run at 144hz and a GTX 1060 6gb. I just bought the monitor and installed windows and after i noticed how choppy it was i went to windows display setting and wanted to change it to 144hz but it only shows 64hz. I’m using DVI-D cable that came with the monitor. Any help would be great! EDIT:i still haven’t installed any drivers for my gpu since my internet is trash nowadays. Thought it was a good idea to update to the latest NVIDIA drivers. Turned out to be not such a good idea since framerates dropped below 20 fps. Before there were 60+ fps with same settings. Did some online research: definitley GW2 running on the HD 530 internal graphics instead of the Geforce GPU. Had this with one other game but a restart solved the issue there. Trying to force GW2 to use the proper GPU, did not work either. Online I found different things to try: upating Intel drivers first. Trying to put my M.2 960 Pros in RAID 0 and I'm getting stuck at the point where I install the Driver. I see the RAID volume in my BIOS. I downloaded the second from the bottom file Here (https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27400/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-?product=55005) on Intel's site. During the windows install it sees the driver when I point to the folder, but after trying for a minute it gives back an error "We couldn't install.device driver" MOBO - Asus Maximu. Recently built new pc. Have spent hours trying to figure out how to get the pc to recognize an Ethernet cable. Tried downloading drivers from msi but when I go to install it says "no intel adapters are present in this computer" please help. MOBO- MSI Z170A SLI Update- Just got it to work.sorry for the bother. Instead of opening the autorun and trying to install the driver like I had been doing I went to the device manager and right clicked on the Ethernet controller to browse files and select. 
Hi Reddit! So, in a valiant effort this morning, I woke up at 2AM EST to catch the inventory refresh for the Dell Outlet to try to find a good deal on an XPS 15 that would retain a large portion of its resale value (I always keep my stuff in pristine condition and prioritize temperatures over performance for longevity). I ended up with a 9570 with the 8750H, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD, and FHD screen (I like battery life over 4K screens) for just under 00 before taxes. It was a refurbished. I just got my new Dell XPS15, what should i do at first? Is it important to undervolt it? Or should i re install windows? What is important About to receive my GPD Win 2 from AliExpress in the UK. I'm wondering what would be the general checklist to do when one first receives a GPD Win 2. For example: - Should I reinstall Windows 10 (perform full system restore) as I've seen some people suggest? - What is the preferred method for making Windows 10 run with as little interference as possible? - Is there some utility to download to control TDP? - What is the best way to control internal resolution of games, to increase performan. I got my new laptop a couple of weeks ago. First thing I did, was install Arch Linux over it. However, I wanted to dual boot it with Windows 10, so I figured, now's the time to install. But no, alas. I got my Windows ISO (version 1803) from the Microsoft site, dd'ed it onto a USB drive and put it in the USB slot. Then I got a black screen. Absolutely nothing. Just pitch black. No indication whatsoever that the Windows installer is doing anything at all. I have been troubleshooting things. Building a mame cabinet and I have an old computer laying around with a Athlon 64 3800+ was wondering if it would have enough power to run some shmups, metal slug, marvel vs Capcom 2 etc. Also wondering what a good video card would be to pair with this setup. After using my Samsung Odyssey for 5 months, I collected informations on "how to" make it works almost flawlessly, I wanted to compile theses informations here in order to help some of the newcomers in WMR : _______________________ About Bluetooth controllers : _______________________ - If possible, use a Bluetooth 4.0 or 4.1 usb dongle connected to a USB 2 port - To avoid any interferences, connect your dongle to a USB2 port of your motherboard with a short usb2 extension cable Hello all! I have recently decided to completely switch over to linux. I already have installed mint cinnamon on my older dell laptop and have had great luck with it. Before I decided to switch I bought a Windows 10 Dell g7 gaming laptop with NVIDIA graphics card in it. I will list the specs below. I am really enjoying linux mint and would love to install this on my new primary laptop. I have read some story's about issues with NVIDIA graphics cards. Just looking for some advic. </p>
