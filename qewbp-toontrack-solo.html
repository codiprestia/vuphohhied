So, I just got superior drummer and installed everything but now I have a problem. When I load it up in FL Studio, the samples have a terrible crackling (audio pops) sound every time I trigger a sample. This doesn't happen in the standalone toontrack solo application and it only does this in FL Studio when I am using my Focusrite 2i4 interface as the audio device. If I switch to the FL Studio ASIO device and reload SD, it doesn't crackle anymore. So I know it has something to do with my audio.

Hey guys, quick question: Can I already produce own drumtracks with only Toontrack Solo + Superior Drummer 2.0? Like creating my complete own midi files and producing all my self-written drumlines for songs? Or do I need something like ProTools to do that and SD only brings me the samples? tl;dr: Does Superior Drummer also allow you to create fully customized (or self-written) tracks or only provides you with sound samples.

I've re-installed both 32 and 64 bit versions, updated software, and set the plug-in file path in Ableton. Still wont recognize. I can get it to work in Toontrack Solo but I can't write and edit drums like a sequencer. EZplayer Pro is cheap enough. Is this the program I need to write my drum tracks in Toontrack.

I got the trial version of REAPER today and I'm not going to be using it much longer unless I can get this to work. I tried setting up Superior Drummer (which works fine in Toontrack Solo) in REAPER and I followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3DK4cmxZpY) to set everything up. After I waited for SD to "Load Samples" I tested if the drums were working and they weren't. The drums don't make any sound. Making a MIDI loop using the piano roll does nothing.

Sorry to rant, but I have been scouring them interwebs for a believable software solution for recording at home. I live near a major highway so mic’ing a cabinet is useless with all the noise.

Toontrack Solo in title. Guitar Solo Toolbar Internet Networking - Browser Accessories, Freeware,  So, I just got superior drummer and installed everything but now I have a problem. When I load it up in FL Studio, the samples have a terrible crackling (audio pops) sound every time I trigger a sample. This doesn't happen in the standalone toontrack solo application and it only does this in FL Studio when I am using my Focusrite 2i4 interface as the audio device. If I switch to the FL Studio ASIO device and reload SD, it doesn't crackle anymore. So I know it has something to do with my audio. I've been trying to record drums with Superior Drummer in Sonar, but I've been getting serious latency issues. When I run it in Toontrack solo the latency is fine, it only seems to be a problem when I run the program in a DAW. I just installed both programs and am pretty new to recording. I'm running it on a laptop. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. 
Hey guys, quick question: Can I already produce own drumtracks with only Toontrack Solo + Superior Drummer 2.0? Like creating my complete own midi files and producing all my self-written drumlines for songs? Or do I need something like ProTools to do that and SD only brings me the samples? tl;dr: Does Superior Drummer also allow you to create fully customized (or self-written) tracks or only provides you with sound samples. I'm trying to write drum tracks that I can bounce to a DAW and record over. I have Ableton Live 9 Lite but I can't get it to recognize the plug-in. I've re-installed both 32 and 64 bit versions, updated software, and set the plug-in file path in Ableton. Still wont recognize. I can get it to work in Toontrack Solo but I can't write and edit drums like a sequencer. EZplayer Pro is cheap enough. Is this the program I need to write my drum tracks in Toontrack. Hi all! I'm hoping someone in the know may be able to assist me here. I've had my PT8/MBox 2 set up for a few years, and though I've fiddled with it in the past for basic guitar ideas to remember, For the last 9 months I've starting to get really really really into home studio recording (It's amazing what a divorce can inspire you to do, eh? lol). Fast forward to today. My band has liked what I've been able to do for my solo music (using Superior Drummer to program my beats). And we were going. 
I got the trial version of REAPER today and I'm not going to be using it much longer unless I can get this to work. I tried setting up Superior Drummer (which works fine in Toontrack Solo) in REAPER and I followed this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3DK4cmxZpY) to set everything up. After I waited for SD to "Load Samples" I tested if the drums were working and they weren't. The drums don't make any sound. Making a MIDI loop using the piano roll does nothing. So I got ssd 4.0 and I have no idea how to get it up and running. I usually use superior drummer 2.0 in toontrack solo along with my Roland kit and wanted to try ssd 4.0 So my question is is there a free daw I can use like toontrack solo to open ssd 4.0? I have everything installed and downloaded the license Using: Cubase 5, SD2.0, Alesis DM10 eKit, Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 From trolling for a couple hours I noticed that the question of how to setup the DM10 with MIDI has been answered with Toontrack solo. I downloaded Solo and I eventually got my DM10 routing through Solo via USB cable into my PC and it responded to the pad inputs (although very delayed) and played Solo's tones. So my computer is recognizing the DM10 as a MIDI controller so that isn't the problem. Now to Cubase. I've setup. This is my entry to the Toontrack Metal Guitar God 2013 competition. I was just curious what you all thought of it. Also, if you enjoyed it, voting for it would be greatly appreciated! Any criticism/feedback is welcome. Thank you! http://www.toontrack.com/metalguitargod2013.asp#!/entry/624863. Sorry to rant, but I have been scouring them interwebs for a believable software solution for recording at home. I live near a major highway so mic’ing a cabinet is useless with all the noise. Hardware solutions (Kemper, Axe-FX) are simply too expensive other than the Sans Amp pedals (which, make no mistake, are about as bad as the software solutions). So far, I have tried demos or full versions of Guitar Rig, Amplitube, Bias, and Toontrack EZ Mix. I have also tried the Ownhammer IR’s. The biggest key to realistic drum programming is understanding the basics of drumming. Start with learning some basics: Ghost strokes - Drags - Single Paradiddles - Poly-rhythm grooves - Using bass drums in Fills - Next, choose a sequencer editor that is conducive. Heyo, long time guitar player, now into singing more than guitar. I know how much better a 00 guitar plays vs a 0 one so I'm wondering if I'd be similarly happy upgrading vocal recording gear or the "room". but no stores let you demo mics, for example. Feels like shopping for a mattress! Current setup: Mid-2000s MXL 990 w/ pop filter and SE Electronics Reflexion Filter. My shockmount broke, but doesn't seem to matter? Focusrite 18i20 or Behringer UMC204HD (the latter's drivers I'm really new to recording, so if this question has a really simple answer I apologize Hey, all. I've been trying to get into recording for some time now, and I recently came into some money and was able to buy myself some monitors and an interface. Next up is to find out where my guitar/bass sounds and drums are coming from. The guitar and bass are more than likely going to be coming from Amplitube, as I have already downloaded their Custom Shop, and the drums are going to be EZDrummer.
